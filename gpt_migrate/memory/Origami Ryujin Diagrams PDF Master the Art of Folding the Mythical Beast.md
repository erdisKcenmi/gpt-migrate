## What are diagrams and crease patterns?
 
Diagrams are step-by-step instructions that show you how to fold an origami model. They usually consist of drawings or photos of each fold, with symbols and arrows to indicate the direction and type of fold. Diagrams are the most common way to learn origami, as they are easy to follow and understand.
 
Crease patterns are another way to represent an origami model. They show the final result of all the folds on a flat sheet of paper, without any intermediate steps. Crease patterns are usually composed of lines and dots that mark the mountain and valley folds. Crease patterns are more compact and concise than diagrams, but they require more experience and skill to interpret and execute.
  
## Where can I find the diagrams and crease patterns for a Ryujin dragon?
 
Satoshi Kamiya has designed several versions of the Ryujin dragon, each with different levels of detail and difficulty. The most famous one is the Ryujin 3.5, which has over 1000 scales and takes months to fold. However, there are also simpler versions, such as the Ryujin 2.1 or the Ryujin 1.2, which are more suitable for beginners and intermediate folders.
 
The diagrams for the Ryujin 2.1 can be found on Satoshi Kamiya's website[^1^], where he also explains the history and development of his design. The diagrams for the Ryujin 1.2 can be found on Scribd[^3^], where they are available for download as a PDF file.
 
The crease patterns for the Ryujin 3.5 can be found in Satoshi Kamiya's book "World of Super Complex Origami", which can be purchased online or from origami shops. The crease patterns for the Ryujin 2.1 and 1.2 can also be found on Satoshi Kamiya's website[^1^], where he generously shares them for free.
  
## How do I use the diagrams and crease patterns for a Ryujin dragon?
 
To use the diagrams for a Ryujin dragon, you will need a large square sheet of paper, preferably thin and strong, such as tissue foil or unryu paper. You will also need some tools, such as scissors, tweezers, glue and a bone folder. You will have to follow the steps carefully and precisely, paying attention to the symbols and annotations. Some steps may be repeated many times or require advanced techniques, such as sinks, pleats or box pleating.
 
To use the crease patterns for a Ryujin dragon, you will need a similar sheet of paper and tools as for the diagrams. You will also need some experience and intuition in origami, as you will have to figure out how to collapse the crease pattern into a three-dimensional shape. You will have to identify the main features of the model, such as the head, body, legs, tail and scales, and locate them on the crease pattern. You will also have to apply some shaping and sculpting techniques to make your model look more realistic and expressive.
